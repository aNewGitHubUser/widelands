descr="In 1362, the quiet, peaceful life of the inhabitants of the Northern Frisian Islands was disrupted by one of the greatest stormfloods in human memory: Saint Marcellus´ Flood. Is it really nothing more than yet another storm, or a sign from the Gods that the Frisian community on the island of Langeneß is not wanted here?"
hint="This scenario is set in a historical context, but most of the storyline as well as the geography is fiction."
